Brent Crude is one of the world's most important oil benchmarks, serving as a pricing reference for approximately two-thirds of internationally traded crude oil. 
Named after the Brent oil field in the North Sea, this light sweet crude oil is extracted from the waters between the United Kingdom and Norway.

## What are Futures CFDs?

A Contract for Difference (CFD) on Brent oil futures allows traders to speculate on oil price movements without owning the underlying commodity or futures contract. 
When trading Brent oil CFDs, you're essentially betting on whether the price will rise or fall.

## Brent Oil CFD Details

- Contract Size: Typically 100 barrels per lot
- Price Quotation: US Dollars per barrel
- Minimum Price Movement: Usually $0.01 per barrel
- Trading Hours: Nearly 24/5 (Sunday 6 PM - Friday 5 PM EST)
- Settlement: Cash-settled (no physical delivery)

## Key Considerations

- **High Volatility**: Oil prices can move dramatically due to geopolitical events, supply disruptions, or economic data.
- **Leverage Risk**: While leverage amplifies profits, it equally amplifies losses.
- **Overnight Costs**: CFD positions held overnight typically incur financing charges.

## Risk Management Essentials

- **Position Sizing**: Never risk more than 2-3% of capital per trade
- **Stop Losses**: Always use stop losses to limit downside risk
- **Take Profits**: Set realistic profit targets based on technical levels
- **Diversification**: Don't put all capital into oil trades
